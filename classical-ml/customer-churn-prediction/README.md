# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Overview

This project predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn based on demographic and financial attributes using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras and deployed with Streamlit for interactive inference.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow including:

* Data preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model training
* Model evaluation
* TensorBoard visualization
* Model artifact saving
* Streamlit deployment

## Problem Statement

Customer churn is one of the major challenges in the banking sector. Predicting churn helps businesses:

* Improve customer retention
* Reduce revenue loss
* Build targeted retention strategies

This model predicts the probability of a customer leaving the bank.

## Dataset Features

The model uses the following input features:

| Feature         | Description                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Geography       | Customer country             |
| CreditScore     | Credit score of customer     |
| Gender          | Customer gender              |
| Age             | Customer age                 |
| Tenure          | Number of years with bank    |
| Balance         | Account balance              |
| NumOfProducts   | Number of bank products used |
| HasCrCard       | Credit card ownership        |
| IsActiveMember  | Customer activity status     |
| EstimatedSalary | Customer salary              |

Target variable:

* **Exited** → Customer churn status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

cd applied-ml-projects/classical-ml/customer-churn-prediction
```

Create virtual environment:

```bash
conda create -n churn_modelling_venv python=3.11
conda activate churn_modelling_venv
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Application

Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Streamlit Features

The deployed application allows users to:

* Select customer geography
* Select gender
* Enter financial details
* Predict churn probability
* View churn decision instantly

---

## Sample Prediction Workflow

User Input → Preprocessing → Feature Scaling → ANN Model → Churn Probability

---

## Threshold Optimization

Threshold tuning was performed to optimize the precision-recall tradeoff for churn prediction.

Instead of using the default classification threshold of **0.5**, the threshold was lowered to **0.4** to improve the model's ability to detect churned customers.

Results:

* **Recall improved from 49% → 54%**
* **F1-score improved**
* Better sensitivity for identifying potential churn customers

This adjustment helps reduce false negatives, which is important in churn prediction since missing a potential churn customer can result in revenue loss.

## Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning
* Dropout regularization
* Batch normalization
* Learning rate scheduling
* Docker deployment
* Cloud deployment
